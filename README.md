Hi,
name's Dias;

I'm an amateur coder, with some experience in the late Flash (starling) and on a learning process with JavaScript (using Node);
Hopefully soon enough I'll be able to put up some nice projects that may be of use to someone going through the same needs I have/had, when creating them;
Hopefully it will be at least minimally comprehensible, not too cluttered, and not extremely inefficient;

If I actually make anything of public use, I'll try my best to always keep it up to date,
and I'll always be interested in feedback or suggestions to make the code better, faster or even add some features;

I don't know if I would be able to fulfill requests, but I sure as heck can try;
So if you need something feasible (not a whole DB System for a company or anything like that),
hit me up and I'll tell you if I'm capable of helping!

I'm by no means any kind of pro, but I try my hardest, so if something isn't perfect, just don't poopoo on my head TOO hard, alright?

Thanks, and bye!
